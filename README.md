<a href="https://www.lightency.io/#/">Lightency</a> is a green tech startup that harnesses the power of deep technologies to ensure/accelerate better access to affordable and green energy.

By providing a decentralized solution, we ensure that green energy is produced, consumed, and exchanged locally which lowers the cost and increases efficiency.

</p>

Powerchain is an energy marketplace where energy is tokenised for easier exchange and better monetisation. It offers a solution to avoid energy waste during peak hours, and ensures an easy and affordable access to electricity.

The Powerchain application will serve as the EMS of the solution, managing energy consumption and storage.

The Lightency blockchain will supervise the transactions occuring on the system.

## Powerchain application

The application runs on site, collects data and executes control algorithms
