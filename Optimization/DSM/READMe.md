The proposed algorithm builds upon work to develop a system of scoring an energy transaction. It scores based upon preference of price, locality, and energy generation 
type, alongside the quantity of energy being traded. The algorithm pre-evaluates transactions to determine the optimal transactional pathway. 
The transaction carried out is that leading to the greatest cumulative score.

Based on the work of Myles J. Thompson, Hongjian Sun and Jing Jiang in the article "Blockchain-Based Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Method"
